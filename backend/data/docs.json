For the Authenticator App method, scan the QR code displayed on screen using your app and enter the 6-digit code to verify setup. Once enabled, you will be prompted for a second factor every time you log in from a new device or browser. You can manage trusted devices from your security settings. If you lose access to your 2FA method, use your backup codes (provided during setup) to regain access. Store these backup codes safely, as they cannot be regenerated."

If you have forgotten your password, use the 'Forgot Password' feature. If you are locked out due to too many failed attempts (5 consecutive failures trigger a 15-minute lockout), wait 15 minutes before trying again. If 2FA is causing issues, use one of your backup codes to bypass it. Ensure you are using a supported browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+). If login issues persist, clear your browser cache and cookies. Check our status page at status.company.com for any ongoing platform incidents. If none of these resolve the issue, contact support with your account email and a description of the error message you are seeing."
